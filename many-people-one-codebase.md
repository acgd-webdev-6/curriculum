      ## Work together smoothly

      - A process will help teammates work together more easily
      - Let tools help us understand and combine our code
      - The less we do manually the less error prone things are
      - Being transparent is always better
        <br>*Except don’t reprimand teammates in public*

      ## Prevent overwrites

      - With branching we can help prevent code overwrites
      - GitHub will automatically merge when it can
      - GitHub will announce if there is a conflict in the code
      - GitHub is there to *help* us not hinder us

  - content: |
      ## Prevent stupid mistakes

      - Code reviews from teammates to find small mistakes
      - It’s the original author’s job to fix the problems
      - Helps teammates stay “in the loop”
      - Can learn from reviewing—and being reviewed

  - content: |
      ## Encourage smaller problems

      - The smaller the coded problem the better
      - Helps prevent code collisions
      - Working in small pieces improves team collaboration
      - Smaller code chunks are better code chunks
      - Leverage Jekyll to split the code apart
