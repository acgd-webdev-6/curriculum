      ## Prefer asynchronous communication

      *Multi-tasking doesn’t actually work well.*

      Fully dedicating to a task will produce better & faster results.

      Async communication prevents interruptions for dedicated tasks.

  - content: |
      ## Wisely use face-to-face time

      *Write an Issue or it won’t get done.*

      Decisions shouldn’t be made in person—people need time to think.

      Tasks shouldn’t be assigned in person—people will forget.

      Reserve face-to-face communication for engaging with people: brainstorming, personal feedback, etc.

      ## Nobody gets fired for opening an Issue

      *Issue or it doesn’t exist.*

      - Have a question? Open an Issue.
      - Have an idea? Open an Issue.
      - Something wonky? Open an Issue.

      Issues are cheap, easy, permanent, searchable & linkable.

  - content: |
      ## Be mindful of noise

      *Too many notifications is distracting.*

      Contribute to Issues you can make in impact on—avoid drive-by comments.

      Only comment if you have something to add—use “reactions” for support.

      Always provide context in Issues, Pull requests & Commits: “A few edits” isn’t enough information.

  - content: |
      ## Use checklists to make blockers explicit

      *Being obvious is always better.*

      If an Issue is blocked, use todo lists to mention the reasons—and whom.

  - content: |
      ## Issues are organization-wide todos

      *Don’t close an Issue until it’s resolved.*

      Issues are a task that needs to be completed or a placeholder for a task.

      Make Issues active: use a verb in the title.

      Long-lasting Issues are completely okay if they still need to be completed.

  - content: |
      ## Keep discussions logically distinct

      *Don’t dump everything into a single Issue.*

      Keep Issues as focused as possible—one single purpose.

      If a concern enters the Issue’s discussion that’s not directly related, open a new Issue and guide people there.

  - content: |
      ## If it has a URL, link to it

      *It’s your obligation to find the URL.*

      People are busy, they shouldn’t have to dig around for the URL of the thing you’re talking about.

  - content: |
      ## Make changes with pull requests

      *Pull request or it won’t get changed.*

      Everything should be reviewed by a peer before entering the `master` branch.

      Create a pull request *early* to get feedback right away.

      Pull requests are team property: the code isn’t *yours* it’s everybody’s to make better.

  - content: |
      ## Be professional

      *Polite, courteous, honest.*

      - Use well constructed sentences
      - Remind people gently
      - Don’t ping, just ask politely
      - Overcompensate for tone
      - Be human
